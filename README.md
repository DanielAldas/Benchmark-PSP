# Benchmark-PSP
Data and scripts used to reproduce the computational experiments: 
1. extracting information from Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) database, 
2. annotating secondary structure annotation of AlphaFold2-predicted structures with STRIDE, 
3. benchmarking secondary structure states (H/E/C) for different protein structure predictors 
   (AlphaFold2, PEP2D, Jpred, PHYRE2), 
4. plotting peptide/protein structural landscape(s).
